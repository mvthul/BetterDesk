# GitHub issues — no closing without explicit command

**Never close a GitHub issue** (via `gh issue close`, GitHub UI automation, or commit keywords like `Fixes #NNN` intended to auto-close) **unless the operator explicitly asks you to close that specific issue.**

## Allowed without asking

- Open or update issues
- Add comments / replies (including verify steps after a release)
- Add or change labels
- Link issues in PRs and commit messages (`Fixes #NNN`, `Refs #NNN`)

## Forbidden unless instructed

- `gh issue close`
- Closing via GitHub API or MCP
- Any workflow step that closes reporter or tracking issues as a side effect

When a fix ships, **reply on the issue** with what changed and how to verify — leave closing to the operator.
